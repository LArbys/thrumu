# ThruMu

This repo is a test bed for a low-level, image-based through-going muon selection.

The goal is isolating through-going muons that will provide a way to study data vs. MC agreement of ADC values.  The sample will allow a comparison versus different parameters such as wire plane and track angle.

With such metrics in hand, hopefully we can begin the path towards data/mc agreement that will lead to better network performances on data.
